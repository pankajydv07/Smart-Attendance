SmartAttend — Progress and Remaining Work (generated 2025-09-29)

What we implemented so far

- Student Dashboard
  - Updated `src/pages/StudentDashboard.tsx` to match Teacher Dashboard header and horizontal nav.
  - Implemented richer empty states for Attendance, Reports and Settings (friendly cards, CTAs).
  - Preserved camera capture and geolocation flow for attendance marking.

- Teacher Dashboard
  - Kept teacher dashboard intact and used as a visual reference.

- Admin
  - Added `src/pages/AdminLogin.tsx` — developer-only admin login that reads credentials from `localStorage` (`dev_admin_user`, `dev_admin_pass`).
  - Added dev helper `src/lib/devAdminSeed.ts` and a "Seed dev creds" button on the admin login page.
  - Added `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` — admin dashboard skeleton with teacher approvals and analytics.
  - Added a simple dev guard: `AdminDashboard` redirects to `/admin/login` when `adminLoggedIn` is not set.
  - Added loading/error/empty UI states so the admin page does not render blank content.

- Utils & Tests
  - Extracted `src/lib/haversine.ts` with `haversineDistance` and `withinRadius` helpers.
  - Added unit tests in `src/lib/__tests__/haversine.test.ts` (Vitest).

Fixes and runtime-hardening performed

- Fixed runtime crash when teacher `status` is undefined by guarding `status` before calling string methods.
- Fixed routing for admin login: registered `/admin/login` route and ensured login redirects to `/admin`.
- Reworked `src/pages/Index.tsx` to avoid import name collisions with local declarations.
- Added small safety checks and user-friendly empty/error states across admin views.

Remaining work / suggested next steps

- Admin dashboard features (high priority)
  - Implement approve/decline API wiring fully and add confirmation dialogs.
  - Add logout button that clears `adminLoggedIn` and redirects to `/admin/login`.
  - Protect admin routes with React Router protected routes instead of full-window redirects.

- Auth & Security
  - Replace localStorage-based dev admin credentials with real authentication and server-side authorization.
  - Add role-based guards across routes so `/admin` is not accessible without proper auth.

- Testing & CI
  - Ensure `vitest` is installed and available in devDeps so tests run in CI.
  - Add test scripts in package.json for running unit tests (if not present).

- Polishing & UX
  - Add more robust error handling and retry strategies for network interactions.
  - Improve empty-state UX with links to docs or admin actions.
  - Add specific components for listings and forms (reusable row components).

How to run locally (dev)

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Run dev server:

   npm run dev

3. To seed dev admin credentials in the browser console:

   localStorage.setItem('dev_admin_user', 'admin@local');
   localStorage.setItem('dev_admin_pass', 'Password123');
   // Then visit /admin/login and click "Seed dev creds" or login with the seeded credentials.

Notes

- This changelog / README was generated automatically to summarize changes made in this coding session. Treat the localStorage-based admin flow as a development convenience only — do not use it in production.

If you want, I can now:
- Implement router-based protected routes and an admin logout button.
- Install `vitest` in devDependencies and wire up tests in package.json so the test suite runs smoothly.
- Add unit tests covering the admin UI rendering for empty/bad-data cases.

Tell me which of these you'd like next and I will proceed and mark progress in the todo list.
